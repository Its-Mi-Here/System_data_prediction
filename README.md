# System_data_prediction
The data was extracted from a computer's task manager. It has instantaneous memory and cpu usage data.

That data is volatile and also has a very few data points. So predictions based on such data are extremely difficult for ARIMA model.
But a Recurrent Neural Network, even though working on a small amount of data has given a very good prediction on the Memory usage data and a fine one on CPU usage data.
